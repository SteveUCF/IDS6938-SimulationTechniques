## Part 1: Numerical Analysis of Integration Functions (25 pts).

(a) - 2pts: Solve for the exact symbolic (analytical) solution.

return y - (1 / 2)*exp(x / 2)*sin(5 * x) + 5 * exp(x / 2)*cos(5 * x);

(b)- 5pts: After step (a) you have the values for the df and exact functions. Translate the
mathematical formulas you now have into the df and exact functions.

(c)- 5pts: Run three numerical integration solutions: RK1, RK2, and RK4 to generate the numerical
and exact values. To start use h = 0.1, for x =< 0.0, 10.0 >. (Hint: this produces 100 values
for each solution.) Graph the results of RK1, RK2, and RK4 and the exact solution. (Use whatever
approach you like to graph this data: R, Python, Matlab, Excel - you should produce a graph with
4 curves.)

(d)- 5pts: Plot the error percentages for RK1, RK2, and RK4 in another graph. Remeber the
error is defined as : %error = jexactô€€€approxj
exact .

(e)- 5pts: Vary the step size h = n where you define three n values for x =< 0.0, 10.0 >.
Plot the results just for RK4 with 3 different n values (with the exact solution). Plot the error rate.

(f)- 3pts: Analyze you results: (1) Describe how varying the integration method changes the
accuracy. (2) What happens as you increase the x value to the accuracy. (3) How does varying
the step size effect the accuracy. (4) Which method is the most accurate and why (in particular
explain what is taken to account in the solution).


##Part 2: Programming a Jello Cube

##Part 3: Written Questions
 What is the effect of the Ks and Kd parameters on the jello? 
##Ks and Kd parameters create the jiggle in the jello after collision.

 What are the benefits and the drawbacks of the collision system used here? What are some
different ways in which it could be improved? 
##Add a temperature element-- how hot or cold the temperature is can actually affect the jello cube in real life. Hotter temperature can liquify the jello, colder temperature can impact the consistency and collision. The simulation can take temperature into account.

 What are some example systems you could model with Mass-spring simulations? Explain
how you would you construct the model. 
##Mass Spring simulations could help to simulate tires of an airplane touching the ground on landing. The rotating tires have compression when they hit the ground. Simulation can help understand airpressure, how large/small the tire needs to be, lifetime of the rubber, etc. I would construct the tire with motion and velocity. 

 Does the jello behave realistically? What integration method did you choose to make the
Jello stable? 
##Yes, the jello cube behaves realistically. I used RK4.

 How would you model and simulate water (in terms of a continuous simulation)?
##I would use jello spheres. I would make lots of them and make them relatively very small and adjust the collision so that there would be slight bounciness and this response would act as a way to stick to each other.
